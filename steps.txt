- remove uncessary layers from paper model [Done]
    - remove Relu in Autoencoder
- replace load from np to load from csv [Done]
- write tensor shape change in rul model [Done]
    - see TensorChanges.ipynb file


Next Steps
- add data viz to data for better transparecy
- test common encode-decode transformer to time series prediction
- why auto-regressive couldn't have loss decrease
- quantization model?


- think about a scope/journal to publish the paper
    - Betty be PI?
        - Find another student?
    - based on matr dataset
    - new postional encoding
    - compare to all other results
